    abstract = "{LASSO regression has been shown to outperform standard methods in some settings. However, it is not a panacea to the problems of overfitting and optimism bias, and does not remove the need to validate a model in an external dataset. Additionally, the LASSO approach trades off potential bias in estimating individual parameters for a better expected overall prediction. A corresponding important disadvantage of the LASSO approach is that the regression coefficients may not be reliably interpretable in terms of independent risk factors as the focus is on the best combined prediction, not on the accuracy of the estimation and interpretation of the contribution of individual variables. Variants on the general LASSO approach exist, such as ridge regression and Elastic Net4, and the relative merits of penalization regression techniques is an area of ongoing research.}",

With a higher number of antennas, pilot-based channel estimation faces a limitation in the number of orthogonal pilots to be used among users in all cells. Sparse channel estimation by using regularization methods can reduce the pilots compared to pilot-based channel estimation.In this paper, we study two regularization methods: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) and elastic net. We investigate the performance of least squares (LS), lasso,and elastic net when the sparsity of the channel changes over time. We study the optimum tuning parameters for lasso and elastic net based channel estimators to achieve the best performance with the different number of pilots and values of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).Finally, we present the asymptotic analysis of LS, lasso, and elastic net based channel estimators.},
